# Vehicle-Detection-And-Speed-Tracking-using-OpenCV-Python
This project contains a Python script for tracking vehicles in a video and estimating their speed using the OpenCV and dlib libraries.
This script reads a video, detects and tracks cars using Haar Cascade and dlib's correlation tracker, estimates their speeds, and displays the results on the frames.  


 Software Requirements:
● Operating system: A current operating system, like Windows, Linux or MacOS
should be used on the computer.

● Software for Image Processing: To process and examine the images that the cameras
have collected, an image processing software library is needed. We have used
OpenCV.

● Programming Language: The software and methods for overspeed detection and
license plate identification must be implemented using a programming language.
Here, we have used Python.

● Other libraries: dlib, numpy, threading, time and math
